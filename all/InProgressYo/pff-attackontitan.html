	<h2>The first thing I think of when I think &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; is &quot;Bee Movie&quot;</h2>

<p>My girlfriend <a href="http://t.fod4.com/t/6bcba43310/c1280x720_50.jpg">Janie Liu</a> has been droping these subtle hints about watching &#39;Attack on Titan&#39; like</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Hey you know what&#39;s a good anime? Attack on Titan.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You know you should watch Attack on Titan, its really good.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Hey watch an episode with me, &quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Wait are you even listening? Hey Michael! MICHAEL! Wake up!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;At which text did you fall asleep at?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Michael?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Goodnight. asshole.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>I couldn&#39;t figure out what she was saying initially, since I was asleep, but after waking up and thinking about it a little I slowly began to realize what she wanted.</p>

<p>After Janie told me that yesterday&#39;s texts were not a subconscious cry for help to get me to pet her head, I was admittedly lost for a moment. Then I began to read yesterday&#39;s texts for the first time and everything suddenly became clear.</p>

<p>She does <em>not</em> like it when I fall asleep, and also something about <em>Attack on Titan</em>. So I went to Google and read a little about the show. It <em>sounded</em> good, but I thought before I <em>officialy</em> begin watching <em>Attack on Titan</em> I should write a fanfiction apology to my love Janie: to say sorry for falling asleep on her and to introduce her to this cool new show I found!</p>

<p>But this is no ordinary fanfiction it&#39;s <em>Pre</em>fanfiction, it is a fiction bringing together my life stories and small details about the show that I found skimming through Google search results.</p>

<p>I am not yet a fan, but I hope to one day become one. The road is long and difficult, but I hope that you reader, as well, will be inspired by my fiction enough to join me in <em>becomming a fan</em>.</p>

<h1>Chapter One: The Super-ego</h1>

<p>The attack was imminent, everyone was on the edge for the attack, and the attack was certain to happen, and the people of the Shiganshina district were certain of it.</p>

<p>These were the feelings of over one hundred years ago, the people of the Shegashnina were now quitely at peace living in their fortified city. They have lived there for over a century seeing or hearing none of the so-called &#39;Titans&#39;, unforgiving human-like creatures which spanned anywhere from LeBron James to a really dilapitaed Trump tower in height.</p>

<p>Michael Eden, however, knew none of this, he was happily riding through his morning patrol route. Since the first Titan attack the Seongchina district decided to erect three huge cocentric walls around itself, and to never again <em>go outside</em>. The &#39;Agoraphobia Policy&#39; as I&#39;ve decided to call it contributed little and even some dared say diminished the district&#39;s imports. </p>

<p>Since then hunger and poverty set in, niceties like education were neglected, and soon everyone forgot exactly why they never went out of their walls. Those who rallied against the walls were imprisoned, for the walls had always been and the people found comfort in their permanance. They didn&#39;t know exactly why the walls had to be there, except that it was immensly important that they were. Michael Eden had the duty of improsoning those anti-wall blasphemous hippies, he didn&#39;t know exactly why, or exactly why it should bother him. </p>

<p>This led to the widely not-discussed &#39;Hippie Hunts&#39; in the year 65 after <em>the event</em>, there were a lot of hippies in &#39;65.</p>

<p>During year 100 after <em>the event</em>, Michael Eden thought life was wonderful. He was admittedly very popular and did many popular things to sustain his popularity. But Michael thought a lot of things, for example he thought he could talk to women, he thought he was clever, good-looking, and overall the best person in existence. He was very certain of this last fact: he was, without a doubt, the most impressive and the most unimaginably greatest person. Ever.</p>

<h1>Chapter Two: The Most Impressive and the Most Unimaginably Greatest Person. Ever.</h1>

<p>Her name was Janie-san or &#39;Jason&#39; for short, but nobody but her brother called her that. She was in fact perfect in every way, a real straightforward archetypal heroine, which <u>precluded her from any character development whatsoever</u>. Oh and she wanted to move out of her brother&#39;s house, badly.</p>

<h1>Chapter Three: The Ego</h1>

<p>Eren Yeager or &#39;Yeagermister&#39; as he desparately wanted to be called, lived in a shack on the outermost wall of the district. He was technically &#39;outside&#39; but the district would pardon this the grounds that he is where his family had always been, just as the wall had been where it always has. He in this sense, shared something with the wall.</p>

<p>Yea&mdash; well I&#39;ll humour him &mdash; Yeagermister, was a lone wolf, a batman, a guard, he and his ancestors were tasked with protecting the district from whatever it was that the walls were built for in the first place. He lived with his sister Janie-san and received little attention and compensation for his work. Everyone in the Shiganshi district loved the walls more than they loved him, or knew who he was. </p>

<p>Yes Yeagermister was pretty content with his life, his sister by his side, some supply of food, and a shack he built on his own. He was in truth a pretty stupidly proud, but all around kind man. </p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a thud that rambled and echoed through his entire shack. The earth beneath him shook, his shack collapsed on top of him.</p>

<h1>Chapter Four: The Morning Route</h1>

<p>Fifteen minutes before Yeagermister&#39;s shotty construction backfired, Michael was pleasantly driving on his morning patrol route. </p>
