	<h2>The first thing I think of when I think &quot;Attack on Titan&quot; is &quot;Bee Movie&quot;</h2>

<p>My girlfriend <a href="http://t.fod4.com/t/6bcba43310/c1280x720_50.jpg">Janie Liu</a> has been dropping these subtle hints about watching &#39;Attack on Titan&#39; like</p>

<ul>
<li>&quot;Hey you know what&#39;s a good anime? Attack on Titan.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;You know you should watch Attack on Titan, its really good.&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Hey watch an episode with me, &quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Wait are you even listening? Hey Michael! MICHAEL! Wake up!&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;At which text did you fall asleep at?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Michael?&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Goodnight. asshole.&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>I couldn&#39;t figure out what she was saying initially, since I was asleep, but after waking up and thinking about it a little I slowly began to realize what she wanted.</p>

<p>After Janie told me that yesterday&#39;s texts were not a subconscious cry for help to get me to pet her head, I was admittedly lost for a moment. Then I began to read yesterday&#39;s texts for the first time and everything suddenly became clear.</p>

<p>She does <em>not</em> like it when I fall asleep, and also something about <em>Attack on Titan</em>. So I went to Google and read a little about the show. It <em>sounded</em> good, but I thought before I <em>officially</em> begin watching <em>Attack on Titan</em> I should write a fanfiction apology to my love Janie: to say sorry for falling asleep on her and to introduce her to this cool new show I found!</p>

<p>But this is no ordinary fanfiction it&#39;s <em>Pre</em>fanfiction, it is a fiction bringing together my life stories and small details about the show that I found skimming through Google search results.</p>

<p>I am not yet a fan, but I hope to one day become one. The road is long and difficult, but I hope that you reader, as well, will be inspired by my fiction enough to join me in <em>becoming a fan</em>.</p>

<h1>Chapter One: The Super-ego</h1>

<p>The attack was imminent, everyone was on the edge for the attack, and the attack was certain to happen, and the people of the Shiganshina district were certain of it.</p>

<p>These were the feelings of over one hundred years ago, the people of the Shegashnina were now quietly at peace living in their fortified city. They have lived there for over a century seeing or hearing none of the so-called &#39;Titans&#39;, unforgiving human-like creatures which spanned anywhere from LeBron James to a really dilapidated Trump tower in height.</p>

<p>Michael Eden, however, knew none of this, he was happily riding through his morning patrol route. Since the first Titan attack the Seongchina district decided to erect three huge concentric walls around itself, and to never again <em>go outside</em>. The &#39;Agoraphobia Policy&#39; as I&#39;ve decided to call it contributed little and even some dared say diminished the district&#39;s imports. </p>

<p>Since then hunger and poverty set in, niceties like education were neglected, and soon everyone forgot exactly why they never went out of their walls. Those who rallied against the walls were imprisoned, for the walls had always been and the people found comfort in their permanence. They didn&#39;t know exactly why the walls had to be there, except that it was immensely important that they were. Michael Eden had the duty of imprisoning those anti-wall blasphemous hippies, he didn&#39;t know exactly why, or exactly why it should bother him. </p>

<p>This led to the widely not-discussed &#39;Hippie Hunts&#39; in the year 65 after <em>the event</em>, there were a lot of hippies in &#39;65.</p>

<p>During year 100 after <em>the event</em>, Michael Eden thought life was wonderful. He was admittedly very popular and did many popular things to sustain his popularity. But Michael thought a lot of things, for example he thought he could talk to women, he thought he was clever, good-looking, and overall the best person in existence. He was very certain of this last fact: he was, without a doubt, the most impressive and the most unimaginably greatest person. Ever.</p>

<h1>Chapter Two: The Most Impressive and the Most Unimaginably Greatest Person. Ever.</h1>

<p>Her name was Janie-san or &#39;Jason&#39; for short, but nobody but her brother called her that. She was in fact perfect in every way, a real straightforward archetypal heroine, which <u>precluded her from any character development whatsoever</u>. Oh and she wanted to move out of her brother&#39;s house, badly.</p>

<h1>Chapter Three: The Ego</h1>

<p>Eren Yeager or &#39;Yeagermister&#39; as he desperately wanted to be called, lived in a shack on the outermost wall of the district. He was technically &#39;outside&#39; but the district would pardon this the grounds that he is where his family had always been, just as the wall had been where it always has. He in this sense, shared something with the wall.</p>

<p>Yea&mdash; well I&#39;ll humor him &mdash; Yeagermister, was a lone wolf, a batman, a guard, he and his ancestors were tasked with protecting the district from whatever it was that the walls were built for in the first place. He lived with his sister Janie-san and received little attention and compensation for his work. Everyone in the Shiganshi district loved the walls more than they loved him, or knew who he was. </p>

<p>Yes Yeagermister was pretty content with his life, his sister by his side, some supply of food, and a shack he built on his own. He was in truth a pretty stupidly proud, but all around kind man. </p>

<p>Suddenly he heard a thud that rambled and echoed through his entire shack. The earth beneath him shook, his shack collapsed on top of him.</p>

<h1>Chapter Four: The Morning Route</h1>

<p>Fifteen minutes before Yeagermister&#39;s shoddy construction backfired, Michael was pleasantly driving on his morning patrol route. He loved passing through the deep reds of the innermost section of the district, and the snowy whites that followed in its middle ring, all the way to the red again in the outer ring. Its sections were meant to be themed red, white, and blue representing the flag of the Shahahnghsi, but a budget snafu and two very bitter and determined interior decorators permanently painted the district in candy cane.</p>

<p>He had just arrived at the final wall to turn back around when he heard a large thud of disappointment coming from the other side. Then in that moment Michael&#39;s clarity beat him into epiphany.</p>

<p>&quot;Ouch! My clarity!&quot; Michael&#39;s segway screeched to a halt. The thud came again. &quot;Aw man, that sounds scary, but my clarity told me its like my job to help people or something.&quot; Michael took his time thinking. &quot;Hey! Maybe there&#39;s babes over that wall.&quot; Another thud. Michael frantically jumped on his thug segway and awkwardly made his way to the wall door. &quot;I&#39;m coming babes!&quot;</p>

<p>This wasn&#39;t heroism, it was progress. It took two more thuds to reach the other side and Michael began to worry that the brisk pace of his segway just wasn&#39;t enough. He used it for one more thud to reach a small pile of what used to be a shack, and starting digging for babes.</p>

<p>Inside the town mass hysteria erupted as many townspeople realized that the walls could protect them from the sides, but not from the <em>ground itself</em>.</p>

<p>Michael first unearthed a broken Eren Yeager who pleaded for his unknown hero to save his sister before him, so Michael left him and started digging again. He removed some rubble and wood off a charcoaled face that looked back at him intensely.</p>

<p>&quot;Woa..&quot; Janie-san stumbled, &quot;You&#39;re really tall..&quot; It was true, Michael was about two meters in height.</p>

<h1>Chapter Five: More Dialog From Janie-san</h1>

<p>Michael pulled her out of the rubble, &quot;Erghm, Hi.&quot; she replied. Another thud came, they were growing in intensity. Michael and Janie-san both swelled with meaningless infatuation as she tried to flirt with him, &quot;so your a real police officer huh?&quot; </p>

<p>&quot;Yes I am.&quot; Michael stated, courageously for some reason. An awkward silence beat Janie-san&#39;s attempts at a reply into submission. &quot;So.. your a real woman then huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Jason! Pfft, ew. Jason are you alright?&quot; Yeager said before she had a chance to reply to Michael&#39;s question. Yet another louder thud shook the earth. Cleaning himself off Yeagermister climbed out of his shack&#39;s rubble, he smelled like failure. &quot;What the <em>hell</em> is going on?!&quot; Another thud. &quot;I think it&#39;s time Jason! They&#39;ve come.&quot; </p>

<p>The earth rumbled and shook and buckled once more. Yeagermister excitedly swam through the rubble. He found a sword that had been passed down to him from his ancestors. He quickly yanked it out of the rubble and broke his sword doing it. It was very old. Feeling betrayed, he ran up the stairs to the wall&#39;s watch tower and rang the bell to call in reinforcements. The entire trip took him three thuds, but Michael had already offered to lend him the segway twice. </p>

<p>Janie-san froze, Michael peed a little, and Yeagermister braced for death as a sixty meter tall Titan slowly walked out of the tree line and towards the district.</p>

<h1>Chapter Six: The Id</h1>

<p>He was very tall, slim, and missing his genitals. He was classically handsome and sixty meters in height and he simply had no trace of his genitals. This worried Yeagermister and simultaneously relieved <a href="http://www.mpaa.org/">MPAA Ratings Board</a> (the bastards) and even still simultaneously proved to be an important plot point.</p>

<p>He was a very big man, lonely I bet too, and he was walking straight towards the Swahili district carrying a long sheet of paper proportional to his size. This, Yeagermister had determined, was a peace treaty.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey that&#39;s a peace treaty!&quot; Yeager yelled as if someone was listening to him. Both Janie-san and Michael were fixated on what was happening near the wall entrance. Sirens were blaring, women and children were being corralled into life boats, and the full force of the Shanagain district was lined up and prepared for war. Everyone stood still until a lonely &quot;Fire at will.&quot; from a nearby General broke the silence, and with it their chance at peace.</p>

<p>Rockets were fired indiscriminatingly, ammunition was being used up by the truck load, and altogether it was a very wasteful eight seconds before the Titan Colossus broke a hole in the first wall. Eight seconds after that the General attempted to create peace talks will the belligerent person, and eight seconds after that he decided that history would not look fondly upon the poor old General and he fled the scene.</p>

<p>All the while it took Yeagermister eight seconds, then to climb up to the watchtower in fear, another two to realize this was a bad idea, ten more to contemplate his poor life choices, three after that to find a switch, and a final two seconds to pull it, because, well, what the hell. It was an unfortunate coincidence really that if the General had just another second of thought before fleeing he could be credited, at least in part, with what happened next. </p>

<p>As the Titan grabbed hold of the two opposite edges of the break in the wall he found that his muscles tensed up, and he could not let go. He was being electrocuted, and it caused the muscles affected to tense and create a firmer grip on the wall. Energy passed through him in unimaginable scale, and it was a short three seconds before it stopped and left the Titan speechless and visibly emotionally hurt from the process. </p>

<p>Twenty Eight seconds ago, while all this was still new, Yeager decided to cower in a watch tower and Michael decided it was time to man up and follow him. Although first, he thought, he would search through the shack rubble to find a stylish, less pee stained pair of slacks. This, in fact,  took him far longer than the battle, the search for diplomacy, and ultimately the electrocution. </p>

<p>All while he was doing that, Janie-san determined that the Titan had been holding a peace treaty and she promptly started to protest the war, which of course as history now knows, lasted all of eight seconds. </p>

<p>&quot;He has a peace treaty! Stop firing! Everyone stop. I said STOP! Please anyone?!&quot; The sound of war drowned out Janie-san&#39;s pleading, maybe it was because she didn&#39;t make signs like normal protesters do, or maybe it was because the military hadn&#39;t really had anything to do for quite some time. Whatever the reason, nobody listened. Then five seconds into the firing a cruise missile hit the Titan&#39;s left hand, causing him to release his proportionally sized piece of paper which flew away with the wind.</p>

<p>The peace treaty was gone, or so they thought.</p>

<p>But that was all history now. Thirty seconds in the Titan began turning away, realizing his hand was empty from it not acting as insulator to his electric shock. As he turned to the forest the people of Shakaraka firmly began to feel a victory coming on. They weren&#39;t used to this.</p>

<p>The leftover commanding Sergeants saw this golden public relations opportunity and seized it for all the media attention it could offer.</p>

<p>&quot;People of the Shaghaghi,&quot; a Sergeant who found a microphone said, &quot; I have great news to offer you today. Today your militia stands triumphant in the war between good and evil. It was through our incredible aforethought and stick-to-it-ness that prevented any horrendous casualties, and in a few words, saved our lives.</p>

<p>&quot;We have, today, won the battle, but not yet the future battles that will definitely happen.&quot;
The crowd gasped a worried but patriotic gasp.</p>

<p>&quot;We need to recharge the wall!&quot; &quot;YEAH!&quot; The crowd cheered. </p>

<p>&quot;We need more funding for the military, we need to give it more stipends and discretionary funds!&quot; &quot;Yeah!&quot; the crowd was still only slightly in spirit. This guy was still milking it.</p>

<p>&quot;It needs to be taken more seriously sometimes, and newer clothes, and a girlfriend!&quot;
&quot;WOOOHOO!&quot; A lone audience member yelled. The Sergeant was quickly running out of speech ideas, and he was loosing his crowd, so he was thankful when Janie-san spoke up with an idea he did not have to come up with.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey what about the peace treaty?&quot; She protested.</p>

<p>&quot;Peace? We tried to give him peace but he wouldn&#39;t have it!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No I mean he was holding a peace treaty in his left hand, until you idiots went and threw a rocket into it&quot;</p>

<p>Seeing as this wouldn&#39;t go over well with his reputation the Sergeant offered a rebuttal: &quot;Silly woman, there was no peace treaty, believe me I want peace as much as you do, but it just wasn&#39;t there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;ll bring peace to the people!&quot; A voice came out of the far right and seemed to start at a man who was quickly trying to put on some slacks.</p>

<p>&quot;I will bring you a peace treaty from those devils, and just in case I fail Sergeant, all your people can stay here and prepare for battle. I only ask that I bring Janie-san with me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Michael you&#39;re a genius!&quot; swooned Janie-san. Michael seemed to be popular with everyone now, he mostly just liked the feeling and didn&#39;t really know what a peace treaty was, or what one looked like. The only thing that even remotely resembled a sheet of paper that Michael would recognize were these weird &#39;receipts&#39; that kept being handed to him in the local Starbucks.</p>

<p>&quot;And me!&quot; Yeager called out.</p>

<p>&quot;Who the hell are you?&quot; the Sergeant boomed.</p>

<p>&quot;I was the guy that saved your lives! I was on that wall and switched on the power! I am your hero!&quot; Yeager prepared for his own crowd cheer.</p>

<p>&quot;Look sorry kid but the truth is it was our planning that turned the wall on.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;YOU WANT THE TRUTH? YOU CAN&#39;T HANDLE THE TRUTH! Sir, we live in a world that has walls, and those walls have to be guarded. You don&#39;t want the truth because deep down in places you don&#39;t talk about at parties, you want me on that wall, YOU NEED ME ON THAT WALL!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Uh.. listen Michael take him with you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Aye aye!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ugh&quot; Janie-san groaned.</p>

<p>&quot;I&#39;m not a captian.&quot; said the Sergeant.</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry what?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wha? Nothing, just go all of you, go away and go find peace or something.&quot;</p>

<p>There was a short pause.
&quot;OK!&quot; said Michael. And the three of them packed a few of their belongings and headed out to find the lost peace treaty. The were sent off with a blessing from the Sergeant and a cheering parade. Soon after they passed the tree line the voices of their townspeople became dim, then almost silent.</p>

<p>A few steps into their adventure Janie-san felt like she had something that needed to be addressed. </p>

<p>&quot;Does anyone smell urine?&quot;</p>

<h1>Chapter Seven: Camping</h1>

<p>Urine and its uncomfortable stank had occupied their minds for the first leg of their trek.</p>

<h1>Chapter Eight: Night Terrors</h1>

<h1>Chapter Nine: Target</h1>
