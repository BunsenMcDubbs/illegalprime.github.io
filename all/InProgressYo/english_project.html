<h1>Why I Miss My Girlfriend</h1>

<p>Granted my girlfriend is not <a href="http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/MSNBC/Components/Video/130201/tdy_godaddy_ad_130201.jpg">Bar Refaeli</a> (she&#39;s hotter) and while she <em>does</em> have a name, I think for the sake of her online presence I&#39;ll omit it. The point is I miss her, and you know what I&#39;m doing about it? Nothing. Well nothing <em>about it</em> more exactly. Which doesn&#39;t help much either. We&#39;re fighting more, worrying more, I have never been this busy in my life, and I guess I don&#39;t want to have to choose between her and my school. I can&#39;t.</p>

<p>I am a hideous man. I neglect her to finish my research, I go do the interviews for the jobs I can only by a fleeting chance ever get. My computer is breaking, I&#39;ve just had to hit it to be able to type again. I don&#39;t have enough money for another one. This happened because I fell skateboarding on my way back from my one weekly &#39;Org&#39; I try to make it to. I fell because I&#39;ve been tired all week, and consequently forgot to call home. My grandmother died this week.</p>

<p>I&#39;ve tried to follow everyone&#39;s advice on how to succeed, if I don&#39;t how can I put food on the table in front of her? I also promised to learn how to cook. I promised a lot. I&#39;m starting to fail classes just based on my lack of organization. She thinks I&#39;m not as committed to this as she is, she is right. I can&#39;t complain, she&#39;s had the worst childhood of anyone I know, but she only recently told me. I worry she&#39;s wasting her time with me, she worries I don&#39;t love her. I think I do, but often I start to wonder what that means anyway. Professors tell me that with age life gets worse. In thirty minutes I will be calling my Abba (dad) to console him. I miss her.</p>

<p>I am one of those unlucky souls who isn&#39;t Christian, or anything for that matter. So what author controls my only humanities and life-philosophy-related class?</p>

<h3>David Foster Wallace.</h3>

<p>What an utterly miserable mistake, one of his short stories is exactly about an Electrical-Engineer at MIT who went through a massive breakdown (and breakup). Maybe I am the only one who did not find anything helpful in his writing.</p>

<p>But why am I telling you this? Why you? I don&#39;t even know you. Why are you, an anonymous person, a substitute for my girlfriend? A better question is why is the Internet even a better substitute? The real question is what, out of everything I have, is actually  important?</p>

<p>The classic trope goes that I can tell you because I don&#39;t know you, which I have to admit it true, although I would&#39;ve loved to be more original.</p>

<p>Anonymity is the closest we will ever see to a person&#39;s true feelings. Every man is like a cat, Schr&ouml;dinger will always see him differently than he sees himself. By extension the language we use in our rants and only-drafted emails are the closest to how we really intend to express ourselves (although language is not a perfect method of expression).</p>

<p>My question is if this inherent imperfection in language has lead to an overall measurable sexist tone. If there is a tone, where is it more prevalent? It would make sense that the more sexist areas are closer to the origin or fault of this sexism, a sexism that is further diluted as it travels to the less bias dense communities in the world.</p>

<h1>How Can The Internet Help?</h1>

<p>Whenever I am alone and to myself I always turn to the Internet. The Internet is much like my girlfriend, it is a place that I can say whatever I want, meditated or not, and not fear any kind of <em>real</em> judgment or any really <em>real</em> implications. In other words I am protected by anonymity in place of love. So I decided to take a look at how Reddit, my social media, does in terms of sexism.</p>

<p>This I&#39;ve done purely out of curiosity, purely out of interest to get an up to date zeitgeist of how sexist this Online community is.</p>

<p>Doing this, for lack of a better word, was <strong>HARD</strong>. It was <strong>really hard</strong>, I won&#39;t go into the implementation here, but I assure you fetching this data and the rest in this paper constituted about 4,000 &quot;words&quot; in code and 15,442,836 &quot;words&quot; in data if we are converting Computer Science work to English units.</p>

<p>I developed a test to measure sexism in language. Without advanced artificial intelligence and conversation mapping, something as subtle as sexism (to a computer) would be impossible to pick up on. And it still is. So I&#39;ve compiled a list of profanity based off of <a href="https://gist.github.com/jamiew/1112488#file-google_twunter_lol">Google&#39;s Official List on GitHub</a> that assigned each word to a number. (It did this through bit shifting) The number would represent a string of binary in which different bit positions were assigned to things like Homophobia, Misogynistic, Anti-Male (words like &quot;Cock&quot; or &quot;Balls&quot;), Beastiality-Related, you get the idea.</p>

<hr>

<h2>This data was parsed off of the top posts in Reddit&#39;s rather vulgar sub: /r/Rants</h2>

<p><html>
<script src="/media/english/ui/redditCommentsGraph.js"></script>
<div id="redditContainer" style="min-width: 310px; height: 500px; margin: 0 auto"></div>
</html></p>

<p>This is basically a measure of how much we relate anger to anti-female words in out language. This holds true regardless of the topic, since hopefully not <em>all</em> rants are about women or men as a gender. The idea is if profanity is used, how much of it is male-related or female-related? If there is an overabundance of anti-female language compared to anti-male language across all posts with profanity, then it points to an inherent sexism in our language.</p>

<p>Reddit, surprisingly, has not a lot of difference (although it is worth noting that the Top 20 all had profane language in them) between male and female words. Although in every post were an anti-female comment is used, it is used more than anti-male comments, and this case happens 11 out of the 21 top posts. However anti-female cursing does happens at or below 25% every time.</p>

<p>Reddit is much cleaner than I expected, and it seems that while sexist comments control a maximum of 12% of the thread, it is still much less sexist than the main stream.</p>

<p>I feel that the less sexist something is, the further away it is from the source and cause of it. I see it more as a concentration gradient. This naturally leads me to pornography.</p>

<h1>Was There a Second Meaning to That Last Title?</h1>

<p>Pornography, in popular media, is some of the most blatantly sexualized (obviously) in the world. However there is still about twice the anti-female profanity as anti-male profanity. This data is much stronger than Reddit and builds a stronger evidence for the existence of sexism inherent in language. Although really this kind of pornography heavily objectifies women more than anything.</p>

    <div id="container-fem" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left"></div>

    <div id="container-bes" style="width: 300px; height: 200px; float: left"></div>
</div>
</html></p>

<p>This, of course, is the outer extreme. But PornHub.com has sexualized women more because that is simply what makes them money, it is, of course, a business after all. Even the worst pornography has a ratio of about 1.7 anti-female words to every anti-male word. So our language only gets to about that level of sexism in its worst condition and environment. This is still higher than Reddit.</p>

<h1>Sexism as a Product of Money</h1>

<p>Think, it sounds like a bad activist group but its true, the story &quot;Think&quot; in Brief Interviews is one of the first that tipped me off to this connection. To where this sexism that is so embedded in our heads is coming from. Naturally this would mean that we should be fully immersed in this media, and by extension that the controllers of such media have a lot of money. In fact this whatever this media is (its movies, and TV, and ads, etc.)  it is decided by the majority demographic with the most buying power.</p>

<p>Guess who that is?</p>

<div><img src="/media/english/bk_ad.jpg" alt="It's white men." />
<blockquote style="border-left: 10px solid #D5D5D5;">It's white men.</blockquote></div>

<p>Wallace would be the first to admit that &quot;We see things a dozen time a day in entertainment&quot; (72) referring to a woman stripping in front of us. In fact Wallace says we not only see a lot of Anoconda-esque, but that we actually learn from it, worse both women and men naively take it as how they should act.</p>

<p>The women seducing him puts on an expression &quot;that looks devastating in a photograph but becomes awkward when its maintained&quot; (73), such an expression is most likely learned from outside media intentionally sexualizing women. And this seductress definitely picks up on it.</p>

<p>In fact television and media and sexism seem to be eternally linked in the mind of Wallace, since the outstanding majority of references to media directly link to sexism. This is also prominent in some of his brief interviews such as the one in the &quot;Harold R. and Phyllis N. Engman Institute for Continuing Care&quot; which blatantly starts off with &quot;As a child, I watched a great deal of American television&quot; (213).</p>

<p>This is not blatantly sexist yes, but from watching <em>Bewitched</em> this man in particular came up with only &quot;masturbation fantasies&quot; (214) of control and power. Now the lead female character actually had the power to control time, but in this show it is actually her husband, I think, which is more powerful. Her husband after all has the power to forbid her from practicing magic, a whim from which most of the conflict of the show is based.</p>

<h1>Why Free is Better</h1>

<p>Freedom and the ability to not be anchored by consumerism is important, especially here. As my last test I parsed five and a half thousand movies against the Bechdel Test, and it shows the staggering amount of movies that still fail to pass it. I believe that this is where the heart of the problem lies, in industry:</p>

<p><html>
<script src="/media/english/ui/bechdelGraph.js"></script>
<div id="bechdel" style="min-width: 310px; height: 400px; margin: 50px auto"></div>
</html></p>

<p>Industry has engrained in our culture certain roles for our gender, there are a plethora of examples of this (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/De_Beers_antitrust_litigation">DeBeer&#39;s</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamergate_controversy">Gamergate</a>). This has been done so different companies can focus on different groups and still both profit. Why do more boys buy videogames? More girls dolls? Why do couples buy diamond rings? Because if they don&#39;t they will be socially outcast.</p>

<p>This is why the Internet is wonderful, this is why I miss her, because the Internet or I with her means no filter, but most of all equality. Everyone will ultimately be listened to, no matter how much money they have, everyone is equal. I mean just imagine if all the content we had was a bank of cliche Hollywood movies and TV (It would probably end like MadMen)? To really attack this problem there must be more information from all sides being broadcast equally.</p>

<p>High grossing movies seem to be the major culprit, although I would probably be much more depressed after a movie from him, David Foster Wallace is actually part of the solution. He is a man that can (being a man) get into a position of power easier and propagate his ideas of gender equality (which he has). The world needs more writers like Wallace, and the world needs an equal platform to distribute their works in.</p>
