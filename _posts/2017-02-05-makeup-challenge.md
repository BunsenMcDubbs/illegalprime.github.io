At this point I know so many makeup words since my girlfriend (the titular
Janie) is really into it. Some of the words I recognize include:

1. BB Cream
2. Sponge
3. Falsies
4. Eye Shadow
5. Blush
6. Contour
7. Blending

If you're thinking "Wow Michael that's a lot!", then you'd be right, it's hard
to stay in _the know_. Something else I know, "My Boyfriend Does My Makeup" is
a popular trend (7 years ago) on the Internet.

So today, after a lot of convincing, I decided it's time for _me_ to be trendy.

## Lessons Learned

Two days later all my eye stuff ("shadow") is not completely gone.
I manically keep moisturizing my eyelids in the hopes it'll come off, I'm almost
there.

I understand now, being a woman is a full-time job.
