Everyone wants to be a hacker these days,
but to be truly l33t, you gotta have a cool retro setup from
boot time to shut down.
So during finals I decided to make a login theme that accurately
captures what it would be like if [Johnny Mnemonic][johnny] owned my laptop.

I use `lightdm`, and since [old habits die hard][mrrobot] I decided to poke
around and see how to make a login theme for it.
Since it was _finals week_ I didn't want to waste time learning GTK or SDL,
and luckily I found `lightdm-webkit2-greeter` on the [AUR][greeter-aur].
After a little bit of being locked out of my desktop, I finally got it:

{% include image.html url="/media/2016-01-31-hackerz/hackerz-demo.gif" description="My new computer login screen!" %}

All the code is available on its [github repo][github]. To set this up
all you need to do is install this greeter, edit `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf`
to contain:

```ini
[Seat:*]
greeter-session = lightdm-webkit2-greeter
```

Place the theme in the themes folder for this greeter,

```bash
git clone 'https://github.com/illegalprime/hackerz.git' /usr/share/lightdm-webkit/themes/hackerz
```

and finally edit `/etc/lightdm/lightdm-webkit2-greeter.conf`:

```ini
[greeter]
webkit-theme = hackerz
```

If you want to make your own cool theme, there's not much docs out there,
but you can take a look at [my code][github] for some guidance, if the
API is still the same when you're reading this.
